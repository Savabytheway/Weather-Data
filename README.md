# Weather-Data

## This code processes and visualizes weather data for a future data analysis.

This is a project, that I made in 2023 as a part of Coursera specialization to practice my data processing and visualization skills.

weatherdata.csv contains daily 2005-2015 weather data

charts.ipynb has 2 cells:
- The first cell finds the hottest and the coldest days in the year, takes these values and visualizes how minimum and maximum temperature changed over years. 
- The second cell visualizes daily minimums and maximums of 2015 on a scatter plot.
